In particular:\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the data records of Boss Level Oy (Data Records) contain Personal Data, Boss Level Oy must comply with applicable data protection laws, including (where relevant) the GDPR.\r\n\r\nThe GDPR requires Personal Data to be deleted or anonymized when they are no longer needed given the purposes for which they are held.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Policy is to ensure that:\r\n\r\nData Records are adequately protected and maintained.\r\n\r\nData Records containing Personal Data, which are no longer required are discarded at the appropriate time.\r\n\r\nBoss Level Oy's data retention principles will help Boss Level Oy to ensure the exercise of individuals' data protection rights.\r\n\r\nCapitalized terms not defined directly in this Policy have the meaning assigned to them in a document connected to this Policy in the form of the Data Protection Policy.\r\n\r\nGUIDING DATA RETENTION PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\nThese are Boss Level Oy's guiding data retention principles:\r\n\r\nFairness: All Processing of Personal Data must be fair, proportionate, and compatible with the purposes for which the data were collected.\r\n\r\nNecessity: Personal Data are deleted when no longer needed.\r\n\r\nSecurity: Personal Data are protected by appropriate security measures.\r\n\r\nIt needs to be ensured that each principle set out at paragraph 2.1 above is followed whenever a Processing activity is envisaged or planned for or on behalf of Boss Level Oy.\r\n\r\nGENERAL RETENTION POLICY\r\n\r\nPersonal Data should only be retained for the period \"necessary\" to achieve our Processing purposes. This means that Personal Data must be deleted when we no longer need such data, for example where:\r\n\r\nthe Personal Data are incorrect.\r\nthe relevant contract has already been performed and possible claims are time- barred; or\r\n\r\nan individual has withdrawn their consent to the Processing (i.e. if consent constitutes a basis for the Processing).\r\n\r\nBoss Level Oy's legal unit should be consulted prior to deleting any Personal Data. Prior to deleting any Personal Data, Boss Level Oy's legal unit should establish whether the limitation periods for any related claims have elapsed, whether the run of the limitation period has been interrupted and whether any related claims have been brought up.\r\n\r\nLegal or regulatory requirements might require Personal Data to be retained for a specified period. For example:\r\n\r\ntax law.\r\n\r\nlabour law.\r\n\r\nYou must therefore consider for each Processing activity:\r\n\r\nwhether any legal or regulatory requirements specify a retention period for Personal Data to be Processed.\r\n\r\nhow long Boss Level Oy will need to retain Personal Data in relation to the proposed Processing activity; and\r\n\r\nwhether the duration of the proposed retention period is necessary for the purposes of the relevant Processing activity.\r\n\r\nThe retained data should be subject to periodic reviews every 6 months with an aim of identifying the data that should be deleted.\r\n\r\nCALCULATION OF THE APPROPRIATE RETENTION PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Retention Tracker is to help calculate appropriate retention periods at the outset of a new Processing activity.\r\n\r\nEach member of personnel (including an employee and associate) of Boss Level Oy must ensure that that any new Processing activities are promptly notified to Boss Level Oy – i.e. to ensure that Boss Level Oy can update the Retention Tracker, where necessary.\r\n\r\nBoss Level Oy is responsible for ensuring that the Retention Tracker is: (i) kept up- to-date; and (ii) reflect the categories of Personal Data Processed.\r\n\r\nInform the Data Protection Coordinator of the proposed retention period of the relevant Personal Data (a Retention Notice).\r\n\r\nPromptly after the receipt of a Retention Notice, the Data Protection Coordinator will:\r\n\r\nverify whether there are any relevant legal or regulatory requirements which will impact the proposed retention period set out in the Retention Notice; and\r\n\r\nprovide a confirmation, in writing or by e-mail, that the proposed retention period complies with this Policy (Confirmation).\r\n\r\nContinual recording of: (i) Confirmations; and (ii) each retention period agreed for Boss Level Oy is important for record-keeping requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Data Protection Coordinator will ensure that each Confirmation is included in Boss Level Oy's repository confirming our retention periods (i.e. the Record of Processing – see paragraph 7 below). The Record of Processing will be maintained by the Data Protection Coordinator.\r\n\r\nHANDLING DATA DURING THE RETENTION PERIOD\r\n\r\nRegulators and individuals may request access to, or enabling the audit of, the Personal Data that Boss Level Oy Processes.\r\n\r\nBoss Level Oy creates and stores Processed Personal Data in secure systems in accordance with auditable processes. Maintaining Boss Level Oy's Record of Processing will assist with this process. In particular, Boss Level Oy ensures that all Personal Data is kept secure (i.e. so as to avoid unauthorized access, alteration, destruction, deletion or tampering in any way for the approved retention period of relevant Personal Data).\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to ensure that the Processed Personal Data are capable of deletion, correction and portability (in response to an individual exercising their Personal Data protection rights). Boss Level Oy preserves the integrity of all Processed Personal Data. In particular, it ensures that:\r\n\r\nProcessed Personal Data are not manipulated or altered.\r\n\r\nany corrections are explicable – Boss Level Oy is able to promptly track and justify changes.\r\n\r\nBoss Level Oy, as soon as practicable, responds to requests from individuals, regulators and other competent authorities to provide information . Boss Level Oy ensures that third party service providers/vendors:\r\n\r\nsecure Personal Data that they Process on behalf of Boss Level Oy in accordance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements; and\r\n\r\ndeliver any Personal Data that they Process on behalf of Boss Level Oy: (i) promptly and without unreasonable delay; and (ii) in any event, within 48 hours of Boss Level Oy's reasonable request.\r\n\r\nWhen you are negotiating contracts with service providers where Personal Data will be Processed on Boss Level Oy's behalf, contact the Data Protection Coordinator for guidance on implementing and reflecting these requirements in the applicable contractual documentation.\r\n\r\nEXPIRATION OF THE RETENTION PERIOD\r\n\r\nData Records must be destroyed responsibly and systematically.\r\n\r\nIf in doubt, the Confirmation should be obtained from the Data Protection Coordinator by contacting bosslevelarcade@gmail.com\r\n\r\nNo records that may be relevant in any current or expected litigation, dispute resolution, or regulatory inquiry may be destroyed under any circumstances without a prior Confirmation from the Data Protection Coordinator. If in any doubt as to the relevance of any record in relation to current or expected litigation, dispute resolution or regulatory inquiry, contact the Data Protection Coordinator.\r\n\r\nDATA STORAGE\r\n\r\nBoss Level Oy maintains a detailed record of our Processing of Personal Data to comply with applicable laws (including data access obligations and security breach notification requirements) (the Record of Processing). The Record of Processing describes, among other things:\r\n\r\nthe location in which the Processed Personal Data are held/stored (e.g. paper files, third party servers, our servers, backup storage);\r\n\r\nthe purposes of the Processing;\r\n\r\nthe legal basis on which Boss Level Oy is processing the relevant data; and\r\n\r\nretention periods.\r\n\r\nThe Data Protection Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the Record of Processing.\r\n\r\nEach member of personnel (including employee and associate) of Boss Level Oy should contribute to updating and maintaining the Record of Processing.\r\n\r\nLOCAL LAW CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nThis Policy has been drawn up in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR and the provisions of Finland law.\r\n\r\nWhere any local legal or regulatory requirements impose additional or more restrictive standards than this Policy, such jurisdictional specific policies shall take precedence.\r\n\r\nContact your Data Protection Coordinator if this Policy conflicts with local laws in any way.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINARY\r\n\r\nBoss Level Oy takes its data retention obligations seriously. Boss Level Oy will, if required, report violations of this Policy and related provisions to relevant regulatory, governmental, and other competent authorities.\r\n\r\nIt is your responsibility to comply with this Policy. Failure to comply may leave you personally liable for civil or criminal penalties (including civil or criminal penalties and fines).\r\n\r\nBreaches of this Policy are recorded and monitored. Failure to comply maybe considered during performance reviews for Boss Level Oy's employees, associates and service providers.";
